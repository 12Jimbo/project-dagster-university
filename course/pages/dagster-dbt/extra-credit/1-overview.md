# Overview

Welcome to extra credit, ambitious student!

By this point, you have the a fully functional dbt project in Dagster. You have seen the power of converting individual dbt models into assets and connecting specific models to assets outside of your dbt project.

This is great though it required a little bit of set up. Now we are going to show how to use [components](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/labs/components/) to streamline the process of incorporating a dbt project in Dagster.

Having finished the other lessons, you will have a better appreciation of how components improves the workflows around scaffolding and can help you set up common integrations like dbt.
